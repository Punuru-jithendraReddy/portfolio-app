It is optimized for business users, data analysts, auditors, and engineers who require reliable file-level and data-level comparison with clear diagnostics and structured outputs.\n\nThe tool supports Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV (.csv) files and allows users to upload Source and Target files, dynamically select sheets, configure header row positions, and choose single or multiple business key columns. It includes advanced normalization features such as case-insensitive column matching, case-insensitive data comparison, optional whitespace trimming, and automatic handling of dates, numeric formats, and null values.\n\nComparison results include match percentage calculation, row-level classification (present in both files, missing in target, newly added in target), schema difference detection, and value-level mismatch identification. Intelligent diagnostics provide root-cause analysis, ranked mismatch impact, sample value inspection, and automated recommendations to improve match accuracy.\n\nAfter execution, the tool generates a downloadable, business-friendly Excel report containing an Executive Summary, Column Names comparison, Row Comparison, Unique Values analysis, and Summary Statistics. All files are processed securely in-memory per session, with no permanent storage or external system integration, ensuring data privacy and session-level isolation.\n\nThe tool is ideal for data migration validation, periodic reconciliation, finance and operations audits, schema drift detection, regression testing, and quality assurance for reporting datasets.
